# Lawler Research Group at Cornell & Binghamton Universities

This is a repository for our group website.
Please visit https://lawler-research-group.github.io/ for more information on our research.

We gratefully acknowledge github pages and the creator of al-folio theme(https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).
Setting up your own website is now as easy as it can get. Once you set a repo with github pages activated, publishing
content is just one "push" away. See https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll for more details.
