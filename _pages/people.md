|**Gaurav Gyawali** ![Gaurav Gyawali]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Gaurav_Gyawali.jpg)     | My research interest lies at the interesection of quantum computing and condensed matter physics. I am interested in developing novel quantum algorithms for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices to understand how complex and exotic behaviors in condensed matter systems emerge from simple interactions among the electrons. I am currently working on variational quantum eigensolver(VQE) based algorithms for near-term quantum computers. However, the long term vision is to reach fault-tolerant quantum era, which requires quantum error correction. I am also deeply interested in quantum error correction codes from the perspectives of both quantum computing and condensed matter.|
