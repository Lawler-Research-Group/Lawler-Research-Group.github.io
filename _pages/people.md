    My research interest lies at the interesection of quantum computing and condensed matter physics. 
    I am interested in developing novel quantum algorithms for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices 
    to understand how complex and exotic behaviors in condensed matter systems emerge from simple interactions 
    among the electrons. I am currently working on variational quantum eigensolver(VQE) based algorithms for 
    near-term quantum computers. However, the long term vision is to reach fault-tolerant quantum era, which 
    requires quantum error correction. I am also interested in quantum error correction codes from the 
    perspectives of both quantum computing and condensed matter <a href="mailto: gg454@cornell.edu">Email</a>

    I am interested in strongly correlated systems in condensed matter physics, in particular, frustrated magnets.
    I am currently studying the topological properties of frustrated spin systems that relate classical mechanics
    to quantum magnets. My main focus is on the nonlinear mechanical zero modes that possess topological invariants 
    or certain topological properties which can be related to exotic quantum phases of matter. The long-term goal is 
    to establish a theory or an approach to study the unsolved quantum models by a simple picture in classical mechanics.

    My name is Eric Aspling. I am a fourth-year PhD. student studying relativistic quantum information. 
    A few of the other areas that I have studied include phononic vibrations in crystalline and amorphic structures, 
    dark matter, and generalized particle statistics (parastatistics). My main interest is understanding 
    time in the realm of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. This problem has been haunting physicists 
    for many decades and is reaching an exciting time in the era of quantum computing. In my free time,
     I communicate physics to the public in various mediums including live events with the World Science Festival and online streaming on Twitch and Youtube.
