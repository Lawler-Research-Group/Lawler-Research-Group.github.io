    My research interest lies at the interesection of quantum computing and condensed matter physics. 
    I am interested in developing novel quantum algorithms for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices 
    to understand how complex and exotic behaviors in condensed matter systems emerge from simple interactions 
    among the electrons. I am currently working on variational quantum eigensolver(VQE) based algorithms for 
    near-term quantum computers. However, the long term vision is to reach fault-tolerant quantum era, which 
    requires quantum error correction. I am also deeply interested in quantum error correction codes from the 
    perspectives of both quantum computing and condensed matter <a href="mailto: gg454@cornell.edu">Email</a> <a href="https://www.gauravgyawali.com">Website</a>
